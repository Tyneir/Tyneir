- 👀 I’m interested in game design, statistical analysis, information organization and streamlining, and ultimately learning more about software and coding as a whole.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing at the moment
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a more simple project to get me started.
- 📫 How to reach me: via my email @ crossroadsofdestiny.stranger@gmail.com.
